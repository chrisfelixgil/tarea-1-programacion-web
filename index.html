        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a tech enthusiast with over 9 years of experience in IT
          infrastructure management, always pushing for excellence in the
          digital world. I love playing video games (FPS and multiplayer RPGs),
          coding, and going to the movies with my wife.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I'm a QA Analyst for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
          Dominican Republic. Before that, I was an IT Infrastructure
          Coordinator at La Innovación S.R.L., ensuring efficient and secure
          tech operations.
          <br />
          <br />
          During my time at the Government Office for Information and
          Communication Technologies (OGTIC), I played a key role as the Head of
          the Standards Research and Documentation Division, contributing to the
          development and update of NORTIC, which are crucial for the Dominican
          Republic. Plus, my experience as a Standards and Regulations Analyst
          allowed me to guide government agencies in NORTIC certification,
          ensuring proper implementation.
          <br />
          <br />
          I've also had roles in the private sector, providing IT infrastructure
          support and maintenance at Grupo Punta Cana and Sheraton Santo Domingo
          Hotel, as well as at AMOV Teleservices International, where I offered
          exclusive support to Claro PR.
          <br />
          <br />
          With a solid educational background that includes a Bachelor's in
          Computer Science and specializations in Project Management, I'm
          dedicated to driving innovation and excellence in technology.
